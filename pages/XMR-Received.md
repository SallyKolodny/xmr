The chart below shows a visualization of the Monero XMR that the mining farm has earned. The data is taken
from the wallet transaction history associated with XMR Mining.

Note that the graph is remarkably linear with a few exceptions:

* On the dates below, I won the [XMR vs. Beast](https://xmrvsbeast.com/) lottery; I qualify for free as an active Monero miner. The *winnings* consist of extra hash power, so the actual earnings vary, but in all three cases, the spike is visible on the graph.

* The slight increase from mid June till the end of the month is when I burned through about $750 free credits of cloud resources and I setup various container configurations (1 CPU up to 8 CPU with 8 Gb up to 32 Gb) to mine in the cloud.
* I added two miners with a modest hash rate of about 750 H/s and 215 H/a in early October, 2024 and you can see the slight increase in the slope of the graph.

The graph shows a direct relationship between hash rate and profitability and also shows that it's a consistent relationship over time.

Finally, for anyone thinking about mining in the cloud: It's not worth it. In fact it's only because my rent includes electricity that I'm able to mine at home and make a profit.
